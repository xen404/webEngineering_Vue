## Setup and local development

1. Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. We recommend anything >= 13.12.

2. If this is the first time, install the required project dependencies with `npm install`.

3. Start a development server using `npm run serve`. This uses the [Vue CLI service](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) to compile your Vue components. It will helpfully complain if you have errors in your code.

4. It is not necessary, but we also recommend installing the [Vue.js devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) for Chrome or Firefox to aid in debugging and development.
